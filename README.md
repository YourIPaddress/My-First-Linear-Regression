# My First Linear Regression
This is my first attempt to make a univariate linear regression model using a simple csv file
The file contains 200 generated examples of data i.e. amt of studyTime : scored marks in CSV form

With appropriate data Univariate regression can be done using any polynomial also. This regression here only uses linear model

- This isn't my first linear regression but it's one of my first implementations of linear regression which I had done sometime ago...
